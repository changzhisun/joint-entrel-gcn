    extraction of entity mentions and relations. We show that attention along with
    long short term memory (LSTM) network can extract semantic relations between
    entity mentions without having access to dependency trees. 
    Experiments on Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) corpora show that our model
    significantly outperforms feature-based joint model by Li and Ji (2014). We
    also compare our model with an end-to-end tree-based LSTM model (SPTree) by
    Miwa and Bansal (2016) and show that our model performs within 1\% on entity
    mentions and 2\% on relations. Our fine-grained analysis also shows that our
    model performs significantly better on Agent-Artifact relations, while SPTree
    performs better on Physical and Part-Whole relations.},

    State-of-the-art models cast the task as an end-to-end problem, 
    solved incrementally using a local classifier.
    Yet previous work using statistical models have demonstrated that global
    optimization can achieve better performances compared to local classification.
    We build a globally optimized neural model for end-to-end relation extraction,
    proposing novel LSTM features in order to better learn context representations.
    In addition, we present a novel method to integrate syntactic information to
    facilitate global learning, yet requiring little background on syntactic
    grammars thus being easy to extend. Experimental results show that our proposed
    model is highly effective,
    achieving the best performances on two standard benchmarks.},
